Service Function Chaining (SFC) placement is a key research area in next-generation networks like 5G and beyond. Most existing approaches aim to find optimal SFC paths based on latency, bandwidth, energy, and reliability. However, there is still scope for improving SLA-aware resource allocation, automating deployment configurations, and using AI/ML techniques like SARIMA for traffic prediction and adaptive reconfiguration.

D. Harutyunyan et al. first proposed an end-to-end slice placement method in 5G networks using MILP to reduce bandwidth usage and VNF migrations while meeting QoS requirements. To enhance scalability, they also introduced heuristic methods.

Building on this, their next work introduced a latency-aware placement model, focusing on minimizing end-to-end delay for delay-sensitive services through ILP optimization.

Later, they extended this with a latency and mobility-aware approach, combining MILP and heuristics to handle user mobility while preserving QoS and minimizing handover disruptions.

Together, these works provide strong foundations, but there is room to enhance real-time adaptability, energy efficiency, and automated decision-making using modern AI-driven methods.

Great question! To connect the first and second paragraphs like a story, we can add a bridging sentence at the end of the first paragraph that naturally leads into the specific research works mentioned in the second. Here’s how you can do it:

First paragraph (with bridge at the end):

Service Function Chaining (SFC) placement is a fundamental research area in next-generation networks such as 5G and beyond. Achieving efficient placement involves addressing multiple factors including latency, bandwidth, energy consumption, reliability, resource utilization, and user mobility. While existing methods often focus on optimizing one or two of these metrics, comprehensive solutions that balance all aspects—particularly under dynamic network conditions—remain a challenge. Moreover, automation in deployment, configuration generation, and AI-driven traffic forecasting (e.g., using SARIMA) are increasingly necessary to meet real-time service demands and uphold service level agreements (SLAs). Several notable studies have approached these challenges from different angles, particularly focusing on how to maintain service performance across complex and evolving network environments.

Second paragraph:

One of the core challenges in this space is the orchestration of end-to-end (E2E) network slices...

The bridging sentence (in bold) acts like a "story handoff" — it wraps up the general idea and sets the stage for the specific research that follows. Let me know if you’d like variations or a full revision of the related work with this narrative structure throughout.
