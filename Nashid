Service Function Chaining (SFC) placement is a key research area in next-generation networks like 5G and beyond. Most existing approaches aim to find optimal SFC paths based on latency, bandwidth, energy, and reliability. However, there is still scope for improving SLA-aware resource allocation, automating deployment configurations, and using AI/ML techniques like SARIMA for traffic prediction and adaptive reconfiguration.

D. Harutyunyan et al. first proposed an end-to-end slice placement method in 5G networks using MILP to reduce bandwidth usage and VNF migrations while meeting QoS requirements. To enhance scalability, they also introduced heuristic methods.

Building on this, their next work introduced a latency-aware placement model, focusing on minimizing end-to-end delay for delay-sensitive services through ILP optimization.

Later, they extended this with a latency and mobility-aware approach, combining MILP and heuristics to handle user mobility while preserving QoS and minimizing handover disruptions.

Together, these works provide strong foundations, but there is room to enhance real-time adaptability, energy efficiency, and automated decision-making using modern AI-driven methods.
